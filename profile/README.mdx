## 🚀 Build Path

BuildPath is the main line of the current R&D DAO operation. Through the following core projects, it forms a cycle from talent cultivation to project implementation, and finally to incentive circulation. This will continuously gather conscientious developers to build, enabling a continuous stream of Web3 new technologies and applications to be developed and implemented. All outputs are open source projects, with processes and funds fully transparent, thereby alleviating the sustainability issues of open source projects in terms of people and money.
